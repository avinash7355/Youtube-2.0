The YouTube-2.0 project is a web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Material-UI. It aims to replicate the functionalities and design of YouTube, providing users with a platform to upload, view, and interact with videos. The application allows users to register an account, sign in, and upload their own videos. It incorporates video playback features like pause, play, seek, and volume control. Users can leave comments, like, dislike, and share videos, enhancing the interactive experience. The project utilizes modern web technologies to create a responsive and visually appealing application that closely resembles the features and aesthetics of YouTube.
